    'I discovered my passion and love for programming at the age of 12 programming in "pawn" a language to create SAMP multiplayer servers. Since then I have always kept learning new and interesting things regarding programming and its good practices. I consider myself a Self-Taught Front-End Developer, I love what I do and I hope you like it too. Currently, I have knowledge about: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React, Redux, JavaScript, PHP, MySql, node.js, mongo.db, git, Ajax, Fetch Api, jQuery, SASS and many other tools that I don´t consider relevant to development web, for any questions, my data is in the contact section, or in the footer of the page. I leave my resume for more information',
